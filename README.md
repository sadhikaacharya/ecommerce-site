# ecommerce-site

An ecommerce site like Amazon that makes use of the MERN stack.

P.S. This is not my original code. I followed a coding tutorial to learn and get familiar with the MERN stack and Javascript. The original code belongs to Coding with Basir. Here is the link to his tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDtPMR5y0QU

Here are some glimpses of what the website looks like:

This project makes use of the MERN stack (Mongo DB, Express, React, and Node) to make an ecommerce websites. All the user and product data are stored in Mongo DB and the frontend makes use of ajax requests to retrieve the data and show it on the website. This project also uses integrated PayPal system that allows user to make payment from Paypal and come back to the website to complete their order. Additionally, it also makes use of JWT to allow users to sign in and log in to their accounts.
